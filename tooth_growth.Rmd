# Introduction

This report will analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. 

## Load the ToothGrowth data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(ToothGrowth)
```

## Basic exploratory data analyses

```{r}
str(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
head(ToothGrowth)
tail(ToothGrowth)
plot(ToothGrowth)
```


## Basic summary of the data

From the plot and data summaries in the previous section we can see that there are three variables:

* Tooth Length (len)
* Supplement (supp)
* Dosage (dose)

We also observe that there are only two Supplements tested:

* OJ
* VC

These Supplements are tested are 3 dosages:

* 0.5
* 1.0
* 2.0

Also there seems to be some sort of positive correlation between dosage and tooth length

## Use confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose
## Conclusions and Assumptions
